## Who I Am

Hello there, I'm Silryn · 澹隐. I live in a quiet and serene place, enjoying a peaceful life—perhaps like a free-roaming cat.

I love computers, writing letters, exchanging postcards, and trying out new things I've never done before!

## What I Do

I'm passionate about technology and creative expression. Whether it's coding, designing, or exploring new ideas, I enjoy the process of bringing thoughts to life.
